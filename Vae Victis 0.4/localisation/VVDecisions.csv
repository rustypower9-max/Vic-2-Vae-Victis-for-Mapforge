deify_hanno_on_title;Enable the Cult of Hanno;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
deify_hanno_on_desc;The Cult of Hanno teaches and encourages migration to new lands, to new colonies. Now is a good time to subtly encourage their worship to help us with further colonization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,, 
deify_hanno_off_title;Disable the Cult of Hanno;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
deify_hanno_off_desc;We have no more need for the Cult of Hanno at this time, we should pass laws restricting their influence once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
convert_neterist_title;Create the Neterist Religion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
convert_neterist_desc;§GThis decision will greatly increase your assimilation of the Kemetic culture! (400%)\n\n§!It's proven rather difficult to assimilate the Kemetic people in our empire. After the initial attempts at Synchronization, the Ptolemies have largely abandoned that effort in favor of maintaining Hellenic orthodoxy, under the influence of the Archon of Athens. This clearly was a mistake: Only through synchronization can we truly create a new Dynasty to rival, maybe even surpass, Alexander.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
settle_kush_title;Settle the lands of Kush;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
settle_kush_desc;Our control of the Kushite kingdoms is rather recent, and most of our Greek Settlers seems to prefer to settle Egypt. We should encourage more settlement and investment into these far flung lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

CRO_inherits_ALB_title;Destroy Nekharot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
CRO_inherits_ALB_desc;After the annhilation of Judea by the Seleucids, many of the rival Diadochi accepted the fleeing Judeans, hoping to use them as loyal warriors and subjects eager to reclaim their holy land. In a perverse act, the Macedonians created a 'New Holy Land' for the Judeans in the former lands of Dardania. We must destroy this farce of a nation and expell the Judeans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
CRO_Dacia_title;Illyro-Dacian legacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
CRO_Dacia_desc;§GThis decision will greatly increase your assimilation of the Dakijan Culture (200%)\n\n§!Our smartest anthropologists have proven without a shadow of a doubt (ignoring any evidence to the contrary) that the Dacians and our Illyrian people were once one and the same. The Dacians recently have come under cultural influence of the Slavic barbarians, calling themselves 'Dakijans' now, but we can easily remind them of our shared legacy by our shared language: The Sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

restore_romana_republic_desc;The Romqart, the 'New Romans' have abandoned their Latin heritage and language for the language of their Punic conquerors.

form_romqart_federation_title;Centralize the Rewmqart Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
form_romqart_federation_desc;Following the collapse of the Carthaginian Empire, the Rewmqart Federation was formed first as just a league of Punic Colonies in Italy to fend off the Gauls, Latins, and Germans.

They even converted and worship Punic gods, fooling the rest of the civilized world to think they were not barbarians anymore. Now with our successful Reconquest of Iberia, we can resettle and recivilze these lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
suebi_retvrn_title;Return Home to Germania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
suebi_retvrn_desc;Many year ago, German Tribes attempted to migrate south to warmer lands. The farthest most got was Pannonia, the rest were brutally slaughtered. We were one of the lucky few who managed to settle in a new land. But our German brothers back home are suffering, languishing in stagnation and poverty. If anyone had the right to bring 'civilization' to the Germans, it's us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
suebi_iber_title;A Suebian Iberia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
suebi_iber_desc;The Celtiberians were rather easy to assimilate, but the Barqanesh proved much more resistant to our rightful claim to these lands. Now though, we've finally snuffed out any resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
sisters_of_tanit_reborn_title;Avenge the Massacre of Tanit's Virgins;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
sisters_of_tanit_reborn_desc;Many years ago, the Civilized World extended much further north into Gaul. However, the perfidious Gauls struck with fury, slaughtering hundreds of villages, including the peaceful virgins at the old Temple of Tanit in Alesia.

end_the_numidian_revolt_desc;§GThis decision will greatly increase your assimilation of the Numidian Culture (200%)\n\n§!With the final destruction of the Mauritanian Kingdom, the Numidian revolt has lost it's steam.

hnb_numidians_title;Punish the Mauritanians;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
hnb_numidians_desc;§GThis decision will greatly increase your assimilation of the Numidian Culture (200%)\n\n§!We lived in harmony with the Numidians, letting them flee to our land and keep their traditions and culture intact. How did they reward us for our cultural tolerance? They massacred our villages and enslaved our people. Now that Mauritania has been destroyed once more, we will not make this mistake again, we will not let a single word of Numidian be spoken in our land!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
form_gothic_empire_title;Form a Gothic Empire;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

PER_focus_on_internal_affairs_title;Focus on Internal Affairs;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

PER_cyrus_legacy_title;The Legacy of Cyrus the Great;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

info_india_title;Vae Victis India Info;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
info_india_desc;The Indian thunderdome is between one native Indian tag and 2 colonizers.

After 690, they will lose their New World status and stop gaining Immigration as all the Immigrants will likely flow to the American Puppets...However they will get a massive assimilation bonus against Barbarian culture after losing their New World status. Essentially, you should try to hoover up as many Immigrants as possible before 690, then you have to actually play like a real nation afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
